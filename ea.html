                <h3 class="header">Location and Geography</h3>
                <p>Eastern Africa is a region of Africa stretching from Ethiopia and South Sudan down through Tanzania and Madagascar. It has a generally tropical climate and is home to sections of the Serengetti, the Ethiopian Highlands, and the Great Lakes. Some animals indigenous to East Africa are: Leopards, Elephants, Striped Hyenas, and Colobus Monkeys.</p>

                <h3 class="header">History</h3>
                <p>Going over the history of East Africa is essential in understanding how it came to be and how it’s history has influenced it’s cultures today. East Africa is largely considered as the cradle of man, where the Bantu-, Nilotic- and Cushitic-speaking groups evolved into the modern hominids that humans are today. The fact that East Africa is in fact the cradle of man is a huge part of it’s diversity and why it is so complicated today. East Africa remained independent and relied solely on their old ways of kingdoms and agriculture until the 15th century when the Portuguese began exploration in Eastern Africa. Their efforts to conquer and takeover the agriculture and Muslim spice trade coming from East Africa led to Islamic and African resistince. The Muslims and Africans drew the Portuguese away which was a huge accomplishment during that time. The Muslims and Africans fighting together led to a good relationship of colonization, trade, and knowledge which lasted throughout the Islamic golden age. The Islamic golden age increased Muslim pressence in East Africa which is still recognizable today. Some ways that they have influenced culture is the food that they eat, the clothes that they wear, holidays, and so on. European colonialism which began in the 19th century also largely reflects on the East African culture today. The Portueguse, Germans, French, and British all controlled parts of East Africa throughout the 19th century. This is also a big part of the melting pot of different cultures that East Africa holds. Having all of these different influences (Muslims, Portueguese, Germans, French, and British) are bound to all make large impacts on a region where all of these different influences mixing together often happens. All of the exposure that East Africans have to each other makes it very easy for cultures to collide that ultimately makes a diverse, confusing, but very rich culture in which is all East African culture.</p>

                <h3 class="header">Culture</h3>
                <p>East Africa is the home to a melting pot of different cultures with over 300 tribal groups, all with different customs and practices. All of these different groups and cultures makes defining the entire culture of East Africa difficult to do. To prepare for our journey to this region, it is important to understand a few of the essential East African customs which are a huge part of their daily life and culture. The largest custom to keep in mind while visiting this region is hospitality. In such a different culture than what we are used to, hospitality counts. Complaining about things such as being thirsty will likely not be accepted by a  culture where it is often necessary to walk 10km to arrive at a water source. Another custom to keep in mind is social hierarchy. While you might not agree with many of these social hierarchies, it is important to keep in mind that it is still a developing country due to all of the setbacks stated before. This means that in many cultures, it is often that men and elders could possibly be higher on the hierarchy and so on. However, an example of how this region is growing in this way could be Kenya and Uganda where their governments are working hard to make women more prominent in their society. The last custom that will be touched on is ways of belonging. In a different culture than our own, it is common that people will look at their nationalities in different ways. An example of this is while Kenyan’s are proud to be Kenyan, they do not look at themselves as Kenyan’s first. First they look at themselves as what tribe they are in rather than their country in almost a tribal humanistic like way. It is important to ask East African’s about what nationality they see themselves as to remain sensitive to their culture. There are many smaller more specific customs that are not exactly essential to their culture but it is still not a bad idea to keep these in mind. Some of these customs include different hand shaking, not eating or passing things with the left hand, respecting authority, not critzsing their country or tribe, and so on.
