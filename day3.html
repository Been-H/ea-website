                <h3 class="header">History of Kenya</h3>
                <p>
                    Kenya has been inhabited by humans for a long time. Early human fossils have been found in Kenya that date back to nearly 1.9 million years ago! But, Kenya has been influenced by foreign powers for a long time. Europeans and Arabs have had a presence in Mombasa since the 14th century. But, Kenya had been having a worldly presence for a much longer time. Mombasa, by the time the Arabs got there, was already a famous port for spices, gold, ivory, and slaves. The Europeans started to explore into the interior of Kenya in the 19th century. Kenya gained independence in 1963.
