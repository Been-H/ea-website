                <h3 class="header">Theme for Trip</h3>
                <p>East Africa. When one thinks of it and of Africa as a whole, what do they imagine? Desolate desert? Poverty-stricken people? People whom we should feel pity for? In part, these preconceptions are accurate. “Africa suffers from a series of misfortunes, several of them geographic, so severe that they have, in combination with perpetuity, put Africans at an incalculable disadvantage.”1 Africa has fallen behind, but not all causes of it are inculpable in nature. These sorts of views of Africa are endemic in societies across the world today and are keeping Africa in the dark. It is these preconceptions and misunderstandings that largely contribute to Africa’s inability to develop at the pace of the rest of the world. East Africa is so much more than this. It is a land of diversity, each country being a melting pot of ethnicities, tribes, customs, languages, animals, and more. It is a land of opportunity. Although it may be home to some of the poorest countries in the world, it is also home to some of the fastest-growing economies. These perspectives and ideas that plague Africa today are embedded deep in our societies stemming back hundreds of years to The Atlantic Slave Trade and beyond.  “Ideas of Africans as inferior, backwards and barbaric can be traced back to those justifying slavery in the 18th century.”2 How we choose to combat this single story of East Africa is our choice and our choice alone. It could quite easily act as a major turning point in Africa’s future. That is why East Africa for The Olympics is excited to present to you our plan for the olympics to be hosted in East Africa.</p>

                <h3 class="header">Our Goal</h3>
                <p>We aim to tell a story. A <span class='e'>new</span> story. One to <span class='e'>break</span> the <span class='e'>single</span> story. That is: </p><span class="e" style="font-weight: bolder;">East Africa, although it has been made out to be a hopeless region, holds immensely interesting diversity and cultural value and importance. It is a region of independence, possibility, and with it, determination to grow and develop, contrary to the single story.</span>

                <h3 class="header">How The Trip Will Work</h3>
                <p>To illuminate this, we have chosen three destinations: Kampala, Uganda; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Nairobi, Kenya. These are not just three random locations in East Africa, becausethey tell a new story and get rid of the old single story.  The story that these three countries tell illuminates the future of East Africa and what Africa as a whole can become. Our journey begins in Uganda, an underdeveloped country that still has plenty of potential to evolve with the rest of its continent. We then travel to Addis Ababa Ethiopia, which is a region which is in the process of developing and it has loads of potential as a city. Lastly, we go to Nairobi Kenya, which is one of the most developed cities in Africa; a rich city with technology that no one with the idea of the single story could even imagine. By going through the process of exploring these three countries, the goal is to show the immense potential that the region of East Africa and the continent of Africa has, and seeing this potential that Africa holds will hopefully get rid of the idea of the single story. Join us on this adventure, and let's dive in! </p>
