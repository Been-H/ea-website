                <p>To thrive in Uganda, simply follow the DOs and DONTs outlined below, be respectful of others, and don't carry out or perpetuate single stories. As you will saw above, one of the common lanugages in Uganda is English. So, if you are from an English speaking country, these people might not be too different from you, so treat them as you would treat a friend back home! Knowing this much about their culture in the first place will make you come across as a much more educated person already.
