                <h3 class="header">Geography of Ethiopia</h3>
                <p>
                    Ethiopia is a land-locked country in Eastern Africa, bordered by Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti, and Eritrea. It is mainly composed of highlands and is surrounded with mountains on nearly all sides, but it also contains Plateaus and semi-arid regions. Like many regions in Africa, it is home to a plethora of Animal species: the Walia Ibex, Ethiopian Wolf, and Gelada Baboons to name a few are only found in Ethiopia.

                <h3 class="header">History of Ethiopia</h3>
                <p>Ethiopia is actually the oldest nation state in Africa being founded in the 13th century! Before this time, the region it resided in was known as Abbysinia and it was ruled by kingdoms and dynasties. During the 19th and 20th century, Ethiopia avoided and defeated numerous colonization attempts by Britain, France, and Italy most notably in the 1930s and 40s during the Italo-Ethiopian Wars becoming one of few African countries to completely avoid foreign interference. What followed was a period of instability, civil wars, and famine until reforms were made. Being free of foreign interference and colonization, Ethiopia serves as a better and more pure representation of what Africa is today.

                <h3 class="header">Government of Ethiopia</h3>
                <p>Ethiopia is a democracy, although it is different from many that come to mind today. Ethiopia is a parliamentary republic, meaning the prime minister is the head of the government and a Parliament exercises executive power. A prime minister is elected by the parliament itself not the people. The country is divided into smaller states based on ethnicity which has caused problems in the past.

                <h3 class="header">Modern Day Ethiopia</h3>
                <p>Ethiopia is a quickly modernizing country. Itâ€™s economy is one of the fastest growing in the world at about a 10% growth rate during the 2010s as with its population growth, its moving away from agriculture and centering its economy on constructions and industry, and it is investing large sums into infrastructure. As well, Ethiopia has been reforming its government and experienced its first peaceful transfer of power since the early 1900s in 2012. Ethiopia has generally good international relations; China has invested large sums into the development of its infrastructure and Ethiopia has worked with both Kenya and Sudan. Despite this, Ethiopia still has roughly a 24% poverty rate making it still a developing country.
