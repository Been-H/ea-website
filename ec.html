                <p>Ethiopia is a very traditionalist country with ethnicity and tribal identity over nationalism. They also heavily oppose Globalization as they want their country to represent them and only them. Ethiopia is an immensely diverse country being comprised of over 70 ethinic groups the prominent ones being:

            <div>
                <h3 class="header">Religion</h3>
                <p>Ethiopia is mainly Orthodox Christian with Islam in a close second. There are a few smaller religions practiced but make up a miniscule percent of the population.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="header">Family and Elders</h3>
                <p>Family is a very important aspect of Ethiopian culture. Visiting of family is extremely common and often happens without prior notice. Family names are also important in naming. Ethiopian family has been and still is patriarchal with the father at the head of the family. Girls are expected to learn domestic skills and do more chores around the house than the boys. Elders are a very important part of family in Ethiopia and it is extremely important to respect them.

            <div>
                <h3 class="header">Food</h3>
                <p>Ethiopians eat 2-3 meals per day depending on income. One is usually at school or work and the other 1-2 are at home. Food is served on a common platter and kids usually eat separate from the adults. In Ethiopia, eating out has been frowned upon for a long time due to the importance placed on family. However, it is becoming more common recently. A common ethiopian diet includes: porridge, corn, barley, oats,  and sorghum flour boiled in milk. In the north, people eat a stew called shiro which is a thick stew made from chickpea flour. As well, the people eat kitfo, a red meat with butter and cheese and injera bread. However, there are many dietary restrictions due to religious affiliation for Ethiopians.

            <div>
                <h3 class="header">Recreation</h3>
                <p>Ethiopians love sports, specifically soccer, its national sport. They also love to socialize in coffee shops, going out for sweets with children, and in restaurants. Clubs are actually an extremely important aspect of Ethiopian culture, although they are different from what some may picture when they think of a club. People participate in rotating savings clubs and burial societies to name a couple.

                <p>If you want to thrive in Ethiopia, you simply have to be respectful of traditions outlined in the DOs and DONTs and other people. As mentioned earlier, Ethiopia is a traditionalist country and peoples, so following and respecting those traditions when appropriate will earn you respect and acceptance from the people who live there. Knowing this much about their culture in the first place will make you come across as a much more educated person already.
