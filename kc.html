                <h3 class="header">The People</h3>
                <p>Kenya is extremely diverse and is divided into over 47 ethnic groups or tribes including: 


                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Kikuyu - 22%</li>
                    <li> Luhya - 15%</li>
                    <li>Luo - 10%</li>
                    <li>Kalenjin - 12% </li>
                    <li> Kamba - 12%</li>
                    <li>Kisii - 6%</li>
                    <li> Meru - 6%</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Kenyans tend to be very warm and friendly making it a great place to visit. The people value family as the highest in society with tribal/ethnic identity following closely behind.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="header">DOs and DONTs</h3>
                <p>DO:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Be respectful</li>
                    <li>Try not to refuse hospitality</li>
                </ol>
                <p>DONT:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Don't ever disrespect an elder</li>
                    <li>Avoid reaching for food or objects with your left hand</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="header">Religion</h3>
                <p>Kenyans are mainly Christian with some practicing Islam. Indigenous beliefs from tribes can also have an impact on religion and cause it to vary from person to person.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="header">Family and Elders</h3>
                <p>Family has and is one of the most important aspects of Kenyan life. In the family, the children, along with the elders, are valued very highly in Kenyan family structure. This is because the children are viewed as the future of the tribe, and the elders hold high social status. Similar to many other African countries, Kenyan family has patriarchal aspects with the father of the house supporting the family and the wife and daughters carrying out domestic tasks. Children help with chores from a young age.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="header">Food</h3>
                <p>A kenyan diet consists of many staple foods such as meat (usually goat, beef, lamb, chicken etc.), fruits, and milk. Ugali, a dough, is a common Kenyan food made of cornmeal, millet, or sorghum flour. Kenyans also eat red bean stew, a flatbread called chapati, and gither, which is corn and beans. Similar to in Ethiopia, children do not eat with the adults.  And, as with most of East Africa, it is not ok to eat or pass food with your left hand.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="header">Recreation</h3>
                <p>Like many other places in Africa, soccer is the most popular sport in Kenya. Both soccer and track and field are its national sports. Kenyans love soccer, so you will find it anywhere you go in Kenya. In urban areas, people do many of the things we do here for recreation. In rural areas, poverty is more rampant so the people have to make due with the limited resources they have to have fun by doing things like gardening, socializing, and storytelling.

                <p>Seeing as Kenyans are very welcoming people, you wonâ€™t need to do anything super special to thrive in Kenya. Knowing this much about their culture in the first place will make you come across as a much more educated person already. Simply make sure to be respectful to people and especially elders, follow the DOs and DONTs outlined above, and you will do just great!
