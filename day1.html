                <p>
                    Uganda is a country located in East Africa; it is surrounded by Kenya, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Tanzania. Most of the country is covered in plateaus with some hills and mountains. But, there are some cool topographical features here. In the center of Uganda, there are many tropical forests and grasslands. In the southwestern border of Uganda, there are the Ruwenzori Mountains. Finally, on the eastern side of the country, there are volcanic foothills.

                <h3 class="header">History of Uganda</h3>
                <p>Uganda has been inhabited way before present-day Uganda was established. In fact, evidence shows that Uganda has been inhabited for over 50,000 years. Like many other African countries, Uganda was colonized by Western powers. In 1894, Uganda was declared as a protectorate of the British Empire. After 68 years under the rule of the British Empire, Uganda gained independence in 1962. Before British influence, Uganda had kings. These people were called “Kabakas”, and they ruled over the land of Buganda. </p>
